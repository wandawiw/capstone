            <h2>What is CPTSD?</h2>
                <p>Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) is a more severe form of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is an often misunderstood and underrepresented condition that affects countless individuals worldwide. Unlike PTSD, which typically stems from a single traumatic event, CPTSD results from exposure to repeated and prolonged relational trauma, often during critical developmental years, such as childhood abuse or neglect. My mission is to bring awareness to CPTSD, provide valuable resources for healing, and empower survivors to reclaim their lives.</p> 
                <p>CPTSD can be differentiated from PTSD by five of its most common and troublesome symptoms. </p>
        <section>
            <h4>Five Key Symptoms of CPTSD:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Emotional Flashbacks </li>
                    <li>Toxic Shame</li>
                    <li>Self Abandonment</li>
                    <li>A Vicious Inner Critic</li>
                    <li>Social Anxiety</li>
                </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="unordered-list"></sectionid>
            <h3>Why is this Topic so Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are a large number of people who have CPTSD but not everyone with symptoms will seek care or get diagnosed because they may not even realize they're traumatized.</li> 
                    <li>Most people who have CPTSD either don't know they have it or they have only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, therefore are not receiving the proper care they require to heal.</li>
                    <li>Most people who have CPTSD find it hard to ask for help because of the relational nature of the trauma, so will often look for resources and self help tools on their own.</li>
                    <li>There is limited research on the prevalence of CPTSD because it is a newly recognized diagnosis in Canada (2022) and is not yet accepted as a diagnosis in the USA.</li>  
                    <li>This is because it is not in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), however it has been recognized in the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD) since 2018.</li>
                    <li>Because of this, the professionals who work with people with CPTSD, such as therapists, counselors and social workers, often lack the expertise necessary to adequately serve them because it is not covered in any significant way during their formal education.</li>
                    <li>A direct association between CPTSD and adult ill health has been established by the first and largest research study to investigate the impacts of childhood abuse and neglect on adult health and well-being. The Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) Study found that the greater the number of ACEs (experiences such as physical and emotional abuse, neglect, caregiver mental illness, and household violence) the greater the possibility of disabilities and dysfunction in adult life. ACEs are linked to chronic health problems, mental illness, and substance use problems in adolescence and adulthood. ACEs can also negatively impact education, job opportunities, and earning potential. 
                    </li>
                    <li>According to the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA), in British Columbia alone an estimated 68,000 youth between the ages of 15 and 24 meet the criteria for a substance use disorder, and about 17% of British Columbians – somewhere around 800,000 people – are experiencing a mental illness or substance use issue today.</li>
                    <li>My hope is to provide a safe and supportive online resource community for people with CPTSD that is designed to increase the likelihood of them finding trauma informed healing tools and trauma informed professionals to help them on their healing journeys.</li>

            <h2>How to Find a Trauma-Informed Therapist</h2>
                <p>Finding the right therapist is essential for recovery. Here’s how to get started: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for Certifications: Therapists trained in EMDR, Somatic Experiencing, or IFS often specialize in trauma recovery.</li>
                    <li>Ask About Experience: Make an appointment for a free discovery call and ask questions. Ensure the therapist has experience with CPTSD or complex trauma. Interview as many as you need to until you find someone you feel safe with.</li>
                    <li>Check for Trauma-Informed Practices: They should prioritize safety, collaboration, and trust. </li>
                    <li>Use Trusted Directories: Websites like <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a> or the <a href="https://www.emdria.org" target="_blank">EMDR International Association</a> can help you locate qualified professionals.</li>
                    <li>Please know that you are not limited to selecting a therapist from your city or local area. You can find an online therapist to meet virtually using video conferencing from the comfort of your own home. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com" target="_blank">Psychology Today</a> allows you to search for online therapists, by modality, diagnosis, and there are so many other options to make chosing a therapist easier for you.</li>

                <p>Please watch this video by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, the leading expert on trauma, in which he speaks about the impact of childhood trauma and how it manifests in behaviors such as substance abuse, relationship problems, and eating disorders. He also identifies three key areas where trauma contributes to these challenges and emphasizes that the problems faced by individuals with childhood trauma differ from those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
