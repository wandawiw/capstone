            <h2>What is CPTSD?</h2>
            <p>Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) typically develops after repeated or prolonged relational trauma. Unlike Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which results from a single traumatic event, CPTSD typically develops after repeated and long-term harm caused by people who should have provided safety, like caregivers. It typically happens in childhood, but it can also happen in situations where escape feels impossible, such as in cases of long-term abuse, childhood neglect, or captivity.
