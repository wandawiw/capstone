            <h2>What is CPTSD?</h2>
            <p>Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD)is a more severe from of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is an often misunderstood and underrepresented condition that affects countless individuals worldwide. Unlike PTSD, which typically stems from a single traumatic event, CPTSD often results from prolonged exposure to repeated relational trauma, such as childhood abuse or neglect. My mission is to bring awareness to CPTSD, provide valuable resources for healing, and empower survivors to reclaim their lives. 
            </p>  
            <p>CPTSD, or Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, is a condition that arises from long-term trauma, often during critical developmental years. It is distinct from PTSD, which is usually triggered by a single traumatic event. It can be dileneated from PTSD by five of its most common and troublesome symptoms. </p>
            <h4>Five Key Symptoms of CPTSD:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Emotional Flashbacks</li>
                <li>Toxic Shame</li>
                <li>Self Abandonment</li>
                <li>A Vicious Inner Critic</li>
                <li>Social Anxiety</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                <p>~ I suspect that a large number of people have CPTSD but not everyone with symptoms will seek care or get diagnosed.</p> 
                <p>~ Most people who have CPTSD either don't know they have it or they have been diagnosed with anxiety or depression at some point in their lives.</p>
                <p>~ Most people who have CPTSD find it hard to ask for help because of the relational nature of their trauma. They would rather try to help themselves by doing their own resear than ask somebody for help. </p>
                <p>~ There is limited research on the prevalence of CPTSD because it is a newly recognized diagnosis in Canada (2022) and is not yet accepted as a diagnosis in the USA.</p>  
                <p>~ This is because it is not in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), however it is recognized in the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD).</p> 
                <p>~ Most trauma experts agree that a large number of the diagnosis in the DSM most likely developed as adaptations to childhood trauma and if CPTSD was to be accepted as a diagnosis the DSM would be reduced to the size of a pamphlet. Food for thought!</p>
